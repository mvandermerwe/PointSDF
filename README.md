PointSDF is a novel, point cloud based, implicit surface reconstruction learning architecture based on recent advances in the Computer Vision community [1,2,3]. Our approach uses new advances in point cloud based learning [1] in an architecture designed similar to [2], but with the implicit surface representation introduced in [3]. Our approach allows for fast point cloud based, reconstructions, specifically to be utilized in grasp planning. 

## Design:

![Architecture](images/architecture.png "PointSDF Architecture")

PointSDF represents an object as the zero level set of a function that predicts the Signed Distance Function value for a given query point in arbitrary 3D space around an object. This is a regression problem, which we train using MSE loss.

We embed input point clouds using 4 PointConv embedding layers [1]. Query points are embedded using dropout FC layers. The point clouds are embedded and appended to each input query points's embedding. This joint embedding is passed through 8 FC layers with Batch Norm and ReLU activations (also fed in at layer 4).

## Usage:

### Dependencies:

Our code depends on the following python libraries:
1. Tensorflow (>=1.9.0)
2. numpy
3. mcubes
4. trimesh
5. matplotlib
 
We additionally rely on PointConv for our embedding layers. PointConv should be cloned from [here](https://github.com/DylanWusee/pointconv) and their instructions should be followed to compile their custom TF operations. Additionally, the environment variable `POINTCONV_HOME` should be set to point at the pointconv repository folder.

### Dataset/Models:

You can find relevant datasets and model checkpoint files [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1x_rXjnE2F7iemyIX_TWA0AyRvhCo8eT3).

### Usage:

For full list of options run:
```
python main.py -h
```
Not all options are necessary each run and have reasonable defaults.

Training run example:
```
python main.py --learning_rate 1e-5 --optimizer adam --model_func pointconv --model_name test_training --model_path ~/models/sdf/ --log_path ~/logs/ --batch_size 8 --epochs 100 --training --train_path /dataspace/ReconstructionData/SDF_Full/Train/ --validation_path /dataspace/ReconstructionData/SDF_Full/Validation/ --sdf_count 256
```
